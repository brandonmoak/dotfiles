To enable the 1Password SSH key agent via the command line, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure 1Password CLI is Installed:**
   First, make sure you have the 1Password CLI (command-line interface) installed on your system.

2. **Sign in to 1Password CLI:**
   Use the following command to sign in:
   ```
   op signin [signinaddress] [emailaddress] [secretkey]
   ```
   This will authenticate you and start a session.

3. **Enable SSH Agent:**
   Run the following command to enable the SSH agent:
   ```
   eval $(op ssh agent --start)
   ```

4. **Add SSH Keys to 1Password SSH Agent:**
   You can add your SSH keys stored in 1Password to the agent using:
   ```
   op ssh add --key key-name
   ```
   Replace `key-name` with the name of your SSH key in 1Password.

5. **Configure SSH to Use 1Password SSH Agent:**
   Add the following lines to your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`):
   ```
   Host *
       IdentityAgent ~/.op/agent.sock
   ```
   This tells SSH to use the 1Password SSH agent for key management.

6. **Verify Connection:**
   Test your SSH connection to ensure it's using the 1Password managed keys:
   ```
   ssh username@hostname
   ```
   Replace `username` and `hostname` with appropriate values.

With these steps, you should have the 1Password SSH agent set up and ready to manage your SSH keys.
